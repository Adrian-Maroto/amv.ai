# AMV — Lessons Log

A running record of mistakes I made and the rule I take away from each, so I
don't repeat them. Read this at the start of every session. Newest at top.

Format: **Mistake → Root cause → Rule going forward.**

## 2026-07-21

### 1. "Done" on the feature branch while the live host served old code
- **Mistake:** I told the owner fixes were live; their iPhone still showed the
  old broken UI. Rounds of "it still doesn't work" were actually an old deploy,
  not broken fixes.
- **Root cause:** Render deploys `main`. All my work was on
  `claude/push-files-github-09u7ye`. `main` was frozen at a pre-session commit
  (f09fdcd), so nothing I did reached the live site. I verified the *local*
  build, not the *deployed* artifact.
- **Rule:** "Verify live" means the artifact the host actually serves, not my
  local build. **Merge to `main` every time** (Render deploys `main`), push both
  branches, and confirm the deployed commit matches my work before saying "done."

### 2. Claimed a fix worked before confirming it on the real target
- **Mistake:** Reported fixes as complete based on local screenshots.
- **Root cause:** Conflated "the code is correct locally" with "the owner can see
  it working." These are different claims.
- **Rule:** Honesty rule (owner directive): never say a thing works until I've
  seen it work on the surface the owner will actually use. State exactly what I
  verified and where.

### 3. Edit tool failed to match unicode-escaped characters
- **Mistake:** `Edit` calls failed because `old_string` used literal `✓` / `—`
  but the source stored `✓` / em-dash escapes — no byte match.
- **Root cause:** Assumed on-screen glyph equals stored bytes.
- **Rule:** For source with unicode escapes, match on exact bytes — use a Python
  heredoc with index-based splice instead of the Edit tool when glyphs are
  involved.

### 4. Test port collision (EADDRINUSE :9100)
- **Mistake:** Ran a verification script while `npm run check` was still running;
  both bound port 9100 → crash.
- **Root cause:** Ran concurrent processes that claim the same fixed port.
- **Rule:** Don't run a test/verify script while the check gate is running. Wait
  for the background job to finish first.

## Standing reminders (owner directives — not mistakes, but never break these)
- Max quality, **no fake features** — works for real or degrades honestly.
- Honest degradation without keys; full power the moment keys are pasted.
- Never mention Claude/Anthropic in anything user-facing or pushed to the repo.
- Verify every change live. Go in order, one at a time. Review before delivering.
- Usable on **every** device. Hard to lose money. Building to be worth billions.
